**Optimal foraging theory** (**OFT**) is a behavioral ecology model that helps predict how an animal behaves when searching for food. Although obtaining food provides the animal with energy, searching for and capturing the food require both *energy* and *time*. To maximize fitness, an animal adopts a foraging strategy that provides the most benefit (energy) for the *lowest cost*, maximizing the net energy gained. OFT helps predict the best strategy that an animal can use to achieve this goal.

$$\frac{T_1}{h_1} = \frac{T_2}{h_2}$$

OFT is an ecological application of the optamility model. This theory assumes that the most economically advantageous foraging pattern will be selected for in a species through *natural selection* When using OFT to model foraging behavior, organisms are said to be maximizing a variable known as the **currency**, such as the *most food* per unit *time*. In addition, the **constraints** of the environment are other variables that must be considered. Constraints are defined as factors that can *limit* the forager's ability to maximize the currency. The **optimal decision rule**, or the organism's best foraging strategy, is defined as the decision that maximizes the currency under the constraints of the environment. Identifying the optimal decision rule is the primary goal of the OFT.
